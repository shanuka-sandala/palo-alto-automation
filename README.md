# Palo-alto-Automation
This repository contains the automation tools which I was made for ease my tasks. Hope this will ease yours also.

Here are the tools that I have created;
1. Daily Checklist - This is to get any details that what you wanted to check on the daily basis, in my setup i had to create several dashboards by taking values of them.
2. Daily Checklist to Excel - This tool was made to input the collected data to the excel sheets for ease of viewing.
3. Certificate Expiry Check - This will collect all the certificates in the palo alto device and make you a certificate expiry checker.
4. Configuraton Backup Tool - This tool will gather the running configuration file of the palo alto device.
